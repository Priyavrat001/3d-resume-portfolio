## Approach

1. **Design & Layout**
   - Chose a unique book-style layout with flipping pages for a modern, interactive feel.
   - Used only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS for maximum compatibility and performance.
   - Ensured all content (profile, experience, education, skills, services, project, contact) is concise and real.

2. **3D & Animation**
   - Implemented 3D page-flip effects using CSS3 transforms and transitions.
   - Added smooth animations for page turns and interactive elements.

3. **Responsiveness**
   - Created a separate `responsive.css` for mobile and tablet breakpoints.
   - Used flexible units, media queries, and overflow handling to ensure the site looks great on all devices.

4. **Content Management**
   - Populated all sections with Priyavrat Kumar’s real resume data.
   - Only the most relevant project (App Dashboard) is showcased, as per requirements.

5. **Accessibility & Usability**
   - All navigation and buttons are keyboard-accessible.
   - Color contrast and font sizes are optimized for readability.

## Tools Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and semantic markup.
- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, 3D transforms, transitions, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Page flipping logic, navigation, and minor interactivity.
- **No frameworks or libraries**: Everything is custom-coded for learning and control.
